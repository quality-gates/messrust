# Unused code

Find private fields, locals, private methods, and parameters that nothing in
the file appears to use.

Analysis is single-file and syntax-only. It does not walk the crate graph,
expand macros, or run the type checker. That keeps the check fast and
build-independent — and it also limits what an unused finding can prove.

## Start here

```console
messrust src text rust --ignore-tests
```

| Rule | In `rust` | What it reports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UnusedPrivateField` | Yes | A private named field has no read in the file. |
| `UnusedLocalVariable` | Yes | A local binder has no read in the file. |
| `UnusedPrivateMethod` | Yes | A private inherent method has no call in the file. |
| `UnusedFormalParameter` | No — in `opinionated` | A parameter name has no read in the file. |

`UnusedFormalParameter` stays out of `rust` because unused parameters are common
in trait and callback interfaces.

Full stricter policy:

```console
messrust src text rust,opinionated --ignore-tests
```

Only this component:

```console
messrust src text unusedcode --ignore-tests
```

## Read a finding correctly

A finding means messrust did not see a direct field access, method call,
identifier read, field pattern, or recognized macro token in this source file.
Before you delete anything, check:

1. A child module in another file may still use the private item.
2. A macro may generate or hide the use.
3. A framework may require the parameter name or method shape.
4. A test may use the item when you run with `--ignore-tests`.
5. A write-only site can be deliberate even with no read.

If none of those apply, remove the item and run the crate tests. `rustc` remains
the authority for real name resolution.

## Shared conventions

Names equal to `_`, or starting with `_`, never produce an unused finding.
Rename an intentionally unused binding instead of suppressing the rule:

```rust
fn handle(_context: &Context, request: Request) {
    process(request);
}
```

The target of a simple `=` assignment is not a read. A compound assignment such
as `retries += 1` does count as a read.

The collector matches names across the whole file and does not resolve each
name to one declaration. A read of the same name in another scope can quiet a
finding.

## `UnusedPrivateField`

Checks private named fields (inherited visibility). It does not report:

- `pub` fields
- `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, and other restricted fields
- tuple fields
- fields on a type that derives `Serialize` or `Deserialize`
- fields a supported access or field pattern reads in the file

```rust
struct Worker {
    active_jobs: usize,
    old_label: String, // Finding when the file never reads this field.
}
```

A constructor write is not a read. If code only initializes a field, confirm the
field is still required.

## `UnusedLocalVariable`

Checks binders from `let`, `if let`, `while let`, `for`, and `match` arms.
Parameters are out of scope here — use `UnusedFormalParameter`.

The `exceptions` property accepts a comma-separated list of local names for
stable project conventions. Prefer an underscore prefix for a single ordinary
Rust binding.

## `UnusedPrivateMethod`

Checks private inherent methods. It does not report:

- public or restricted-visibility methods
- trait implementation methods
- methods called in the same file as `self.run()`, `Type::run()`, or `Self::run()`
- methods referenced by a supported bare identifier in the same file

Because analysis is per file, inspect calls from other modules before deleting.

## `UnusedFormalParameter`

Checks function and method parameters except `self`. It reports when the
file-wide read set does not contain that parameter name. A read of the same
name in another function can prevent a finding.

Enable it when the project owns the signatures. Keep it off when an external
interface requires the parameter. If you enable it, prefix a required unused
parameter with `_`.

## Configure an exception

```xml
<ruleset name="project unused code">
  <rule ref="unusedcode/UnusedLocalVariable">
    <properties>
      <property name="exceptions" value="required_marker" />
    </properties>
  </rule>
</ruleset>
```

```console
messrust src text path/to/unused-code.xml --ignore-tests
```

## Suppress one intentional case

```rust
// messrust-disable-next-line UnusedPrivateField
compatibility_marker: u32,
```

Keep exceptions narrow. A project-wide exception can hide a later defect that
reuses the same name.
